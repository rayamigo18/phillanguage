       The Philippine Language School of Victoria (PLSV) was founded 1995 by Perla Adaptar Luetic, the President of LUZVIMINDA Association of Filipino Women in Victoria, Inc.
       to enable the Filipino Children learn and understand the language and culture. The work began in cooperation with the Filipino Community Council of Victoria 
       and Ethnic School Association of Victoria. The school was designed for non-speakers of Filipino Language, or person of Filipino parents who are Filipino-Australian 
       born and who do not speak the language, children of mixed marriages, scholars, diplomats, businesspeople and individuals who are interested to learn the Filipino
       language.
