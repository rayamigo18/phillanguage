              <p>Married with 3 children; living in Australia since 2008. Working as
Education Support at a government school for the past 11 years. I
run a program: Hands on Learning catered towards the well being
and academic engagement of students. The programme consists of
trade skills from carpentry to landscaping from Yr. 4-9.<br></br>
<br></br>
Prior to coming to Australia, I worked in Papua New Guinea from as
a Missionary Volunteer with the Salesians of Don Bosco schools. And
then, I was employed by the Papua New Guinea Department of
Education to teach Science, Biology and Computer Studies and then
as an IT Officer. I moved to an International High School in 2008 before coming to Australia
permanently.<br></br>

I have been a part of the Philippine Language School of Victoria since 2010 and have been reaping
the joys of teaching Filipino language and culture to the young. Although I have had gainful teaching
experience of 20 years, teaching the Filipino language is a challenge and a pleasure when you come
to know that young people show incredible eagerness to learn the language and the culture. This
goes to show that language (and culture) is inherent to anyone regardless of skin colour, beliefs or
background.</p>
